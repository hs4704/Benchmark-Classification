# Benchmark Classification Models for Diabetes and Hypothyroid Prediction
This project explores the application of machine learning classification models to predict two medical conditions: diabetes and hypothyroidism. Using Python and its libraries, various algorithms were implemented, evaluated, and compared to determine their performance on these datasets.

# Project Overview
- Analyzed the datasets for diabetes and hypothyroidism prediction.
- Built and evaluated classification models, including:
		- Logistic Regression
  	- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  	- Decision TreeNaive Bayes
  	- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Compared the modelsâ€™ performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.
# Datasets
1. Diabetes Dataset: A dataset containing features related to diagnosing diabetes.

2. Hypothyroid Dataset: A dataset with features for diagnosing hypothyroidism.
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/thyroid-disease-data-set
# Results
The models were evaluated on their ability to accurately classify the conditions. Key findings included:
- KNN and Decision Trees performed strongly for diabetes prediction, with high accuracy and balanced precision-recall values.
- For hypothyroidism, KNN achieved the best balance of precision and recall, while Naive Bayes showed high recall but lower precision.
# Features of the Repository
- **Python Notebooks**: The notebooks contain all of the preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation and visualizations
- **Datasets**: The diabetes and hypothyroidism datasets are located in the 'data' file, we used these for training and evaluation.
## Lessons Learned 
Through this project, I enhanced my understanding and abiility to:
- Preprocess and clean large medical datasets.
- Implement various classification algorithms in Python.
- Compare and interpret model performance metrics.
- Understand the importance of model selection and evalustion for specific datasets.
